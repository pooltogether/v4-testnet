# PoolTogether V4 Testnet
The V4 testnet deployed contracts and essential hardhat tasks.

# Getting Started
Install `direnv` module.

We use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage environment variables.  You'll likely need to install it.

```sh
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

To run fork scripts, deploy or perform any operation with a mainnet/testnet node you will need an Infura API key.

### Disbursement Address
To `disburse` and `deposit` you will need to add a list of address(es) to DISBURSE_ADDRESSES.


**Example**
```.sh
export DISBURSE_ADDRESSES='0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001'
